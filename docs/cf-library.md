fm-cf-library
=============

Created by Charles Ross, chivalry@mac.com

A FileMaker module that provides a standard custom function libary. With over 400
available functions, this library includes a wide range of readily available tools
for the FileMaker developer.

While I wrote many of these myself, there are quite a few that are from other sources.
I've tried to acknowledge the original author when I could as well as provide a URL to
the web page where the function was originally found. If you find a function that you
wrote without an attribution to you, please open an issue so I can fix that.

Acknowledgements
----------------

Many of these functions are from sources other than myself. I've tried to include
attributions when I knew who originally wrote them, but this information is sometimes
missing. If you know who wrote a particular function for which an attribution is missing
(see the issues for some authors that I'm looking for), please let me know. Among the
FileMaker developers that I can definitively thank for their contributions to the
FileMaker community (in no particular order):

you'd like a link to, send me a URL that you would like attached to your name.

Requirements
------------

FileMaker Pro 12 Advanced or greater is required to use this module, but FileMaker Pro 14
Advanced is recommended. Not all custom functions may work properly in earlier versions.

Integration Instructions
------------------------

Most interested parties won't require these instructions, and probably already know how
to import custom functions into a FileMaker file, but just in case, here's the procedure.

1. Open your file with FileMaker Pro Advanced using a full access account.
2. Choose File>Manage>Custom Functions from the menu bar.
3. Click the "Import" button.
4. Navigate to the location of `fm-library.fmp12`, select it and click "Open".
5. Select all of the custom functions with Cmd-A or Ctrl-A, depending on your platform.
6. Click one of the checkboxes next to a custom function in the list, which should check
all of them.
7. Click "OK" in the "Import Custom Functions" dialog box.
8. Click "OK" in the "Manage Custom Functions" dialog box. 

Conventions
-----------

Read the [conventions documentation](conventions.md), which covers not only the conventions used in the
custom function library, but also across the fm-library project.
